// Validating benchmarks:
// Benchmark LCPBenchmarks.Approach_Sort: DefaultJob
//    * Benchmarked method `Approach_Sort` is within a non-visible class, all declaring types must be public.

// Benchmark LCPBenchmarks.Approach_Shrink: DefaultJob
//    * Benchmarked method `Approach_Shrink` is within a non-visible class, all declaring types must be public.

//    * Assembly Debug Console Application which defines benchmarks is non-optimized
Benchmark was built without optimization enabled (most probably a DEBUG configuration). Please, build it in RELEASE.
